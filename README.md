### First Time User

- For a first time user the menu should be straight forward and easy to navigate as you do not want one which is confusing which could deter them from using it further.

### Returning User

- A returning user should find the first time on the game to be easy to maneuover efficient enough to want to return to the game.

### Frequent User

- It should have different ways to end the game in order for it be replayable.

It should be easy to play with clear input which only accepts "Hit" and "Stick".
